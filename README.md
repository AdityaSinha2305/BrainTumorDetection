# Explainable AI Based Model for Brain Tumour Detection

The Explainable AI Based Model for Brain Tumour Detection is a web application designed to assist healthcare professionals in accurately diagnosing brain tumours using artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze medical imaging data, such as MRI scans, to detect the presence of brain tumours. 
Unlike traditional black-box AI models, this system incorporates explainable AI techniques to provide clinicians with insights into the decision-making process of the AI model, 
enhancing transparency and trust in the diagnostic results.

## Key Features:
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** The system supports user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized healthcare professionals have access to patient data and diagnostic tools.

- **Upload and Processing of Medical Images:** Healthcare professionals can upload medical imaging data, such as MRI scans, to the system for analysis. The system processes the uploaded images using deep learning algorithms to detect potential brain tumours.

- **AI Model Interpretability:**  The AI model incorporates explainable AI techniques to provide insights into the features and patterns that contributed to the diagnostic decision. Clinicians can interpret the AI model's predictions and understand the factors influencing the detection of brain tumours.
